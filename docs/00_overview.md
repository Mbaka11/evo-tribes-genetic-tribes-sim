# EvoTribes — Project Overview

## Goal

EvoTribes is a learning-first research project that explores:

- emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems
- genetic algorithms for policy evolution
- group dynamics (tribes, dominance, cooperation, isolation)
- alignment failures such as reward hacking and proxy optimization

The system is designed to be:

- fully documented
- modular
- interactive
- explainable

This is not just a simulation — it is a behavioral laboratory.

## Core Principles

1. Every component must be understandable.
2. Every iteration must be runnable.
3. All parameters must be configurable.
4. All behaviors must be measurable.

## High-Level Architecture

Environment → Agent Policy → Genetic Evolution → Metrics → Visualization → Interactive Controls

---

## Learning Objective

The purpose of this project is to observe **unexpected emergent strategies** that were not explicitly programmed.
