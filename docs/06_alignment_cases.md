# Alignment Experiments

This project explores reward mis-specification.

---

## Camping Exploit

Rewarding safety leads to agents that stop exploring.

---

## Resource Farming Exploit

Agents exploit a local resource loop instead of solving the intended task.

---

## Fake Cooperation

Rewarding proximity produces agents that group without producing value.

---

## Fix Strategies

- multi-objective fitness
- anti-stagnation penalties
- evaluation in new environments
