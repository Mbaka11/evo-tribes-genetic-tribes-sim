## Iteration XX — [Short Title]

**Version:** `0.X.0`
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** `iteration-XX/short-name`

---

### 1. Goal

_What is this iteration trying to achieve? One or two sentences._

---

### 2. Why This Matters

_Why is this iteration necessary? What does it unlock for future work?
Explain it as if talking to someone new to the project._

---

### 3. What Was Implemented

_List every component that was built or changed. Be specific._

| File              | Change Type        | Description       |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `path/to/file.py` | Created / Modified | Brief description |

---

### 4. Architecture & Design Decisions

_How do the pieces fit together? Why were certain choices made?_

_Include diagrams, flow descriptions, or pseudocode if helpful._

---

### 5. Mathematical Considerations

_Any formulas, equations, or numerical reasoning behind this iteration._

_Write out each formula, explain every variable, and give an intuitive
explanation of what the formula "means" in plain language._

**Example format:**

$$
\text{formula here}
$$

Where:

- $x$ = explanation
- $y$ = explanation

**Intuition:** _What does this formula actually do, in everyday words?_

---

### 6. Algorithms & Logic

_Step-by-step description of any algorithms introduced._

_Use numbered steps. If there's a loop, show one full iteration._

```
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

---

### 7. Key Concepts Explained

_If this iteration introduces something technical (e.g. "observation space",
"genetic crossover", "reward shaping"), explain it here for a beginner._

#### Concept Name

_Definition, why it matters, and a concrete example._

---

### 8. Concrete Examples

_This section is CRITICAL. Provide real, worked examples that show the system in action._

_For each major feature or algorithm, include:_

- Input scenario with specific values
- Step-by-step execution showing intermediate states
- Final output or result
- Interpretation of what this means

**Example format:**

#### Example 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Setup:**

- Parameter A = X
- Parameter B = Y
- Initial state: ...

**Step-by-step:**

```
Step 1: ...
Step 2: ...
Step 3: ...
```

**Result:** ...

**What this shows:** _Plain-language interpretation_

---

### 9. Configuration & Parameters

_List every configurable parameter added or changed._

| Parameter    | Default | What It Controls |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| `param_name` | `value` | Description      |

---

### 10. How to Run

_Exact commands to install, run, and test this iteration._

```bash
# Install
pip install ...

# Run
python -m ...

# Test
python -m pytest ...
```

---

### 11. What You Should See

_Describe the expected output — console logs, visual window, test results._

---

### 12. Known Limitations & Bugs

_What doesn't work yet? What edge cases exist?_

---

### 13. Docs Modified

_Which documentation files were updated and what changed._

| Doc File          | What Changed |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `docs/XX_name.md` | Description  |

---

### 14. Test Coverage

_Which tests were added? What do they validate?_

| Test        | What It Checks |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `test_name` | Description    |

---

### 15. Version History
