## Iteration XX — [Short Title]

**Version:** `0.X.0`
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** `iteration-XX/short-name`

---

### 1. Goal

_What is this iteration trying to achieve? One or two sentences._

---

### 2. Why This Matters

_Why is this iteration necessary? What does it unlock for future work?
Explain it as if talking to someone new to the project._

---

### 3. What Was Implemented

_List every component that was built or changed. Be specific._

| File              | Change Type        | Description       |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `path/to/file.py` | Created / Modified | Brief description |

---

### 4. Architecture & Design Decisions

_How do the pieces fit together? Why were certain choices made?_

_Include diagrams, flow descriptions, or pseudocode if helpful._

---

### 5. Mathematical Considerations

_Any formulas, equations, or numerical reasoning behind this iteration._

_Write out each formula, explain every variable, and give an intuitive
explanation of what the formula "means" in plain language._

**Example format:**

$$
\text{formula here}
$$

Where:

- $x$ = explanation
- $y$ = explanation

**Intuition:** _What does this formula actually do, in everyday words?_

---

### 6. Algorithms & Logic

_Step-by-step description of any algorithms introduced._

_Use numbered steps. If there's a loop, show one full iteration._

```
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

---

### 7. Key Concepts Explained

_If this iteration introduces something technical (e.g. "observation space",
"genetic crossover", "reward shaping"), explain it here for a beginner._

#### Concept Name

_Definition, why it matters, and a concrete example._

---

### 8. Configuration & Parameters
